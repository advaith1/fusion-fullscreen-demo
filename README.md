To use in your app:

1. Download this repo and unzip it (When you download it, MAKE SURE you name it the name you want for your project's HTML folder)
2. In Fusion, go to the HTML5 Options tap of your Application Properties (make sure Build Type is set to HTML5 Development, HTML5 Final Project, or HTML5 Application) and uncheck Generate HTML file
3. Go to File> Build> Application
4. Make sure you set Project name to the name of the folder you unzipped in Step 1, and set Project Path the directory you downloaded the file to.
5. Click OK to build.

Ta-da! Now, you can upload the file to a service using the instructions linked to here: http://clickwiki.net/wiki/HTML5_Runtime#Running_on_a_external_server, or host it yourself using one of the methods here: http://clickwiki.net/wiki/HTML5_Runtime#Running_on_a_local_system.
